# Implement Single Feature Task

Implement one task from the feature pipeline. Invoked once per task with a fresh agent context. The plan is pre-created by the architect in the per-task planning phase. For bug fixes, use `implement-task-fix.md` instead. For full-feature implementation, use `implement-feature.md`.

## Regression Rules (MANDATORY)

- **Regression is not acceptable.** Failing tests that are not explicitly marked as expected failures (e.g., `@pytest.mark.xfail`, `@unittest.expectedFailure`) are regressions and must be fixed before the task is considered complete.
- **Expected failures are acceptable.** Tests annotated with framework-level expected-failure markers are excluded from the regression gate. Do not remove or alter these markers without explicit user approval.
- **Do not claim tests are unrelated.** If a test fails after your changes, it is your responsibility to fix it. You may not dismiss failing tests as "unrelated" or "pre-existing" without explicit user confirmation.
- **Full test suite requirement:** Before marking a task complete, run **all** project tests (Python and Node). All tests must pass (excluding expected failures).

## Prerequisites

- Task document exists at `{features_dir}/{feature_name}/tasks/{task_file}.md` (where `{task_file}` is the basename without `.md`)
- Task plan exists in `{features_dir}/{feature_name}/plans/tasks/{task_file}.md` (created by architect)
- User provides: feature name, task file name without extension (e.g. `01-create-model`)

## Instructions

Execute these phases in order. Focus only on this single task.

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

### Step 1.1: Read Codebase Context

Read relevant files from `{context_docs_dir}/` based on task scope:
- **Always read**: AI_CONTEXT_QUICK_REFERENCE.md, AI_CONTEXT_REPOSITORY.md
- **If affecting specific components**: Read the corresponding component context files in `{context_docs_dir}/`
- **Always read**: AI_CONTEXT_PATTERNS.md

### Step 1.2: Read Changelog

Read root `CHANGELOG.md` (create if it doesn't exist). Understand recent changes and changelog format.

### Step 1.3: Read Task and Plan

1. Read the task from `{features_dir}/{feature_name}/tasks/{task_file}.md`
2. Read the plan from `{features_dir}/{feature_name}/plans/tasks/{task_file}.md`
3. If the plan seems incomplete, request the architect to update it before proceeding

### Step 1.4: Read Scratchpad

Read `{scratchpad}` for feature name, pipeline state, and prior task completions.

### Step 1.5: Analyze Scope

Determine which component(s) are affected based on the task and plan (use project context for component names).

---

## Phase 2: Implementation

Follow the TDD workflow. Run the project's test suite and code quality tools as defined in project rules; reference `@.cursor/workflows/implement-feature.md` for the full workflow.

### Step 2.1: Write Tests First

Create or update tests per the task plan's Test Strategy. Follow component-specific patterns from AI_CONTEXT.

### Step 2.2: Verify Tests Fail

Run tests and verify they FAIL before implementation. If they pass, adjust tests until they correctly validate expected behavior and fail.

### Step 2.3: Implement Code Changes

Implement following the plan's Implementation Order. Follow component-specific patterns from AI_CONTEXT_PATTERNS.md.

### Step 2.4: Run Code Quality Tools

Run the project's code quality tools and fix any issues.

### Step 2.5: Run All Project Tests

Run **all** project tests (not just affected components):

```bash
the project's full test suite (see project rules)
```

**All tests must pass (excluding expected failures).** Any failing test not explicitly marked as an expected failure is a regression and must be fixed before proceeding. Do not claim failures are "unrelated" to your changes.

### Step 2.6: Component-Specific Validation

Complete any validation steps from the plan (e.g. AST parsing, Rete.js rendering).

---

## Phase 3: Completion

### Step 3.1: Update Changelog

Add entry under `## [Unreleased]` in appropriate subsection (`### Added`, `### Changed`, etc.):

```markdown
- Description of the change
  - Plan: [task-name]({archive_dir}/{feature_name}/plans/tasks/{task_file}.md)
  - Task: [task-name]({archive_dir}/{feature_name}/tasks/{task_file}.md)
```

### Step 3.2: Update Documentation

Update relevant files in `{context_docs_dir}/` and component READMEs based on what changed.

### Step 3.3: Archive Task and Plan

Move task and plan to archive:

```
mkdir -p {archive_dir}/{feature_name}/tasks
mkdir -p {archive_dir}/{feature_name}/plans/tasks
mv {features_dir}/{feature_name}/tasks/{task_file}.md {archive_dir}/{feature_name}/tasks/
mv {features_dir}/{feature_name}/plans/tasks/{task_file}.md {archive_dir}/{feature_name}/plans/tasks/
```

### Step 3.4: Final Validation

Run **all** project tests again:

```bash
the project's full test suite (see project rules)
```

All tests must pass (excluding expected failures). Verify no code quality errors.

### Step 3.5: Update Scratchpad

Add to `{scratchpad}`: "Task {task_file} completed, tests passing"

### Step 3.6: Commit Changes

Commit all changes for this task following the Conventional Commits format (per `@.cursor/commands/commit.md`):

1. **Stage changed files**: `git add .`
2. **Safety check**: verify no `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, or `secrets.*` files are staged. If found, unstage them (`git restore --staged <path>`) and warn.
3. **Generate a Conventional Commits message**:
   - Type: inferred from changes (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, etc.)
   - Scope: inferred from affected paths (`parser`, `schema`, `webview`, `extension`, `docs`, etc.)
   - Description: goal-focused, imperative mood
   - Optional body: bullet points, each under 100 characters, goal-focused (describe what the change achieves, not file-specific mechanics)
4. **Execute the commit**: `git commit -m "<message>"`

## Notes

- This workflow is invoked **once per task** with a fresh agent context
- Do not proceed to the next task until this task is fully complete and all tests pass
- The plan was created by the architect in the per-task planning phase; do not create a new plan
